A Google Chrome extension for quick and handy access to the latest CloudSpokes challenges, your payments, leaderboards and more!

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Redesigned, new UI using Twitter Bootstrap</li>
	<li>Notifications for new challenges (checked hourly)</li>
	<li>Login (without leaving the extension)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pages</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Home (see latest stats, blog posts and the twitter feed)</li>
	<li>Open Challenges (see open challenges with ability to filter, sort and search)</li>
	<li>Leaderboard (shows the entire leaderboard returned from the api, grouped on periods with ability to search and sort each column (click on the column name))</li>
	<li>My Challenges (user's active, past and watched challenges; if the user is not logged in it will show a login box)</li>
	<li>Payments (user's outstanding and paid payments; same login behaviour as on My Challenges)</li>
	<li>Inbox (user's messages; same login behaviour as on My Challenges)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>
If I win the challenge I'd like to keep working on the extension. Here's what I plan to do next:
<ul>
	<li>Use Backbone.js (the code will be cleaner and much more organized; I'll also get a chance to learn Backbone.js)</li>
	<li>Add featured member and mini leaderboard (top 3) on the home page</li>
	<li>Improve the Open Challenges UI (I'd like to get rid of the space between the rows)</li>
	<li>Improve UX (take feedback, add transitions)</li>
	<li>Maybe improve the entire UI with a redesign</li>
</ul>
